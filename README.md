If you want to experiment and customise this service, you are at the right place. 
1. You may need to install the Java Development Kit - Java 7 or better.
2. Install the [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Run `java -version` if Java(â„¢) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.X.0_05-b13) X is the version number displays.
3. Set JAVA_HOME.

    Variable name: JAVA_HOME
    Variable value: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_80 (or whatever version your installation is!)
    If the variable already exists, update it to your version of the JDK.
    Verify your JAVA_HOME variable from a cmd.exe terminal: `echo %JAVA_HOME%`.
    ```
    ```
    Mac:
    Set JAVA_HOME to the installation location:
    Open Terminal.
    Navigate to your home directory using `cd`
    Open the file `~/.bash_profile` which is a configuration file for your terminal
    Add the following command to the file:
    `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)`
    Reload the configuration file using:
    `source ~/.bash_profile`
    Enter `echo $JAVA_HOME` to confirm the path.
    ```
